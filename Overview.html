	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p> 
		The exploration of exoplanets—planets that orbit stars outside our solar system—has transformed our understanding of the universe. Since the first confirmed discovery in 1992, thousands of exoplanets have been identified, showcasing a variety of planetary systems and expanding our understanding of planet formation and habitability.

1. The Early Days (Before 1992)
Before the discovery of exoplanets, astronomers could only speculate about the existence of planets beyond our solar system. Despite strong theoretical grounds, no definitive proof of their existence was available. Detecting planets around other stars was a major challenge due to their dimness compared to the bright stars they orbit.

2. First Discoveries (1992-2000)
In 1992, two astronomers, Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail, made the groundbreaking discovery of the first confirmed exoplanets. These planets were found orbiting a pulsar (PSR B1257+12), a rapidly spinning neutron star. This was a surprising discovery, as pulsars are remnants of massive stars that have exploded in supernovae, leading to questions about how planets could survive such violent processes.
In 1995, the first exoplanet around a Sun-like star was discovered by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. This planet, 51 Pegasi b, was a gas giant orbiting its star at a very close distance—a type later termed a "hot Jupiter." This detection revolutionized the search for exoplanets, introducing the radial velocity method, which measures a star's wobble due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.

3. The Kepler Era (2009-2018)
The launch of NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope in 2009 was a watershed moment in exoplanet discovery. Kepler used the transit method, detecting tiny dips in a star’s brightness caused by a planet passing in front of it. This method allowed scientists to detect thousands of new exoplanets and exoplanet candidates, many of which were Earth-sized or located in their star's habitable zone—the region where conditions might be right for liquid water to exist.
Kepler revealed that the universe is teeming with planets. It showed that planetary systems are diverse, and many stars have multiple planets. One of Kepler's key findings was the discovery of Kepler-186f, the first Earth-sized exoplanet found in a habitable zone.

4. TESS and Other Missions (2018-Present)
After Kepler, NASA launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in 2018, designed to survey nearly the entire sky. TESS is expected to discover thousands of exoplanets, focusing on those around brighter stars that are closer to Earth, which allows for follow-up observations.
Ground-based observatories, like the European Southern Observatory’s HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher), and other space telescopes like Hubble and Spitzer, have also contributed to studying exoplanets. These instruments have helped confirm planetary discoveries and provided insights into the composition of exoplanet atmospheres, including the detection of gases like water vapor and methane.

5. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Future of Exoplanet Research
Launched in 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is set to revolutionize exoplanet exploration by providing unprecedented detail about the atmospheres of exoplanets, including potentially habitable ones. JWST’s powerful instruments will allow scientists to analyze the chemical composition of exoplanet atmospheres, which could yield clues about the possibility of life beyond Earth.
