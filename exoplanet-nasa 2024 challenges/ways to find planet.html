        <h1 style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; max-width: 2000px;"> 5 Ways to Find a Planet</h1>
     
		<h1 style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; max-width: 800px;"> Transists</h1>
		<p>This method involves measuring the decrease in brightness of a star as a planet passes in front of it. By measuring the duration and frequency of these transits, astronomers can determine the size and orbit of the planet.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; max-width: 800px;"> Radial Velocity</h1>
<p>This method involves measuring the star's subtle wobble caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. By measuring the star's velocity along our line of sight, astronomers can determine the presence of a planet and its mass.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; max-width: 800px;">Direct Imaging</h1>
<p>This method involves capturing images of the planet directly using powerful telescopes and cameras. This method is often used to study the atmospheres of planets and determine their composition.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; max-width: 800px;"> Astrometry</h1>
<p>This method involves measuring the position and motion of a star in the sky to detect the tiny wobble caused by an orbiting planet. By measuring the star's position and motion over time, astronomers can determine the presence of a planet and its mass.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; max-width: 800px;"> Microlensing</h1>
<p>This method involves measuring the bending of light around a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. By measuring the distortion of the star's light, astronomers can determine the presence of a planet and its mass.</p>
