	<h1>here are few Exoplanets Types</h1>
	<p>Exoplanets come in a wide variety of types based on their size, composition, and distance from their host stars. Here's an overview of the most common types of exoplanets discovered so far:

		1. Gas Giants
		Characteristics: Massive planets primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.
		Examples: Jupiter, Saturn, and exoplanets like 51 Pegasib.
		Subtypes:
		Hot Jupiters: Gas giants that orbit extremely close to their stars. They are much hotter than Jupiter because of their proximity to their stars. Example: WASP-12b.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Cold Jupiters: Gas giants located farther from their stars, similar to Jupiter in our solar system. Example: HD 80606 b.
		2. Super-Earths
		Characteristics: Planets that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune, typically between 1.5 to 10 times Earth's mass. These planets can be rocky, gaseous, or a combination of both.
		Examples: Kepler-452b (often called Earth's cousin), 55 Cancri e (possibly a diamond-rich planet).
		Subtypes:
		Rocky Super-Earths: Planets that are predominantly composed of rock and metal.
		Water Super-Earths: Planets that may have significant amounts of water, possibly in the form of oceans or thick atmospheres of water vapor.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		3. Mini-Neptunes (Sub-Neptunes)
		Characteristics: Planets smaller than Neptune but larger than Earth, often with thick hydrogen and helium atmospheres. They are intermediate in size between Earth and Neptune.
		Examples: Kepler-22b, GJ 1214b.
		Composition: Likely to have a mix of gas and rock with some water, and they may have substantial atmospheres that make them more like small versions of Neptune.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		4. Terrestrial Planets (Rocky Planets)
		Characteristics: Earth-like planets primarily composed of rock and metal, with solid surfaces. These planets are of particular interest in the search for life.
		Examples: Proxima Centauri b, TRAPPIST-1e, Kepler-186f.
		Habitability: Many of these planets are located in the habitable zone of their stars, where liquid water might exist. Rocky planets similar to Earth are prime candidates for finding life.
		<br/>
		
		5. Ocean Worlds
		Characteristics: Planets that are believed to have deep global oceans, possibly hundreds of kilometers deep, beneath thick atmospheres or icy crusts.
		Examples: GJ 1214b (potential water world), Europa (moon of Jupiter, but often compared to ocean planets).
		Composition: These planets may have oceans of liquid water or other liquids like methane, or they may be covered by thick ice layers with subsurface oceans.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		6. Ice Giants
		Characteristics: Large planets with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium but with cores of ice, water, methane, and ammonia. Similar to Uranus and Neptune.
		Examples: Uranus, Neptune, and potential exoplanets like HD 219134 c.
		Composition: These planets are thought to have large quantities of icy materials mixed with gas.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		7. Hot Neptunes
		Characteristics: Neptune-like planets that orbit very close to their stars, leading to high surface temperatures. Their atmospheres can be inflated due to the intense heat.
		Examples: GJ 436b, HAT-P-11b.
		Composition: Composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and ice, but their proximity to their stars causes atmospheric stripping and heating.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		8. Chthonian Planets
		Characteristics: These are former gas giants that have had their outer layers stripped away by intense stellar radiation, leaving behind their rocky or metallic cores.
		Examples: Thought to be the final stages of some hot Jupiters as their atmospheres evaporate. CoRoT-7b is a potential example.
		Composition: These planets may have originally been gas giants, but they now consist mostly of rock or metal due to atmospheric loss.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		9. Rogue Planets
		Characteristics: Planets that do not orbit any star but instead drift through space. These planets may have been ejected from their original star systems.
		Examples: CFBDSIR 2149-0403 is one of the few detected rogue planets.
		Composition: They could be of any type—rocky, gaseous, or icy—but they are difficult to study because they don’t reflect light from a star.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		10. Puffy Planets (Inflated Planets)
		Characteristics: These are gas giant planets with very low density, often because they are extremely close to their stars. Their atmospheres are "puffed up" by the heat, making them much larger than their mass would suggest.
		Examples: HAT-P-67b, WASP-17b.
		Composition: Primarily composed of gas, these planets have a bloated atmosphere due to intense heating from their nearby stars.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		11. Lava Planets
		Characteristics: Planets so close to their stars that their surfaces are covered in molten lava. These extreme environments are caused by their proximity to their parent stars.
		Examples: 55 Cancri e, Kepler-10b.
		Surface: The surface temperatures on lava planets can exceed 2,000°C (3,600°F), leading to oceans of molten rock and active volcanism.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		12. Super-Puffs
		Characteristics: These are a special class of exoplanets with extremely low densities for their sizes. They are larger than Earth, but their mass is so low that they are very "fluffy," with atmospheres potentially full of hydrogen and helium.
		Examples: Kepler-51 planets.
		Density: They have densities comparable to cotton candy, making them some of the least dense planets discovered.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		13. Ultra-Short Period Planets
		Characteristics: Planets with extremely short orbital periods, sometimes less than a day, meaning they are very close to their parent stars.
		Examples: K2-137b.
		Orbit: Due to their short distances from their stars, they experience extreme tidal forces and intense radiation.
		These diverse types of exoplanets highlight the incredible variety of worlds that exist beyond our solar system, many of which have no analogs in our own planetary neighborhood.
