	<h1>what is Universe?</h1>
	<p>
        The universe is the vast, all-encompassing space that contains everything in existenceâ€”matter, energy, galaxies, stars, planets
     and all forms of life. It includes all physical laws, forces, and constants that govern how these entities interact. The universe is thought to have begun approximately 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, a massive expansion event that created all matter and energy.

        Key Characteristics of the Universe:
    </h1>
    <p>
        Space-Time: The universe is made up of space and time, forming a four-dimensional framework where all matter and events exist.
Galaxies: It contains billions of galaxies, which are large systems of stars, dust, and gas held together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is one of them.
Expansion: The universe is continuously expanding, with galaxies moving farther apart from each other. This was discovered by observing that distant galaxies appear to be moving away from us, a phenomenon known as cosmic expansion.
Matter and Energy: The universe is composed of:
Ordinary Matter: Atoms that make up stars, planets, and living beings (about 5% of the universe).
Dark Matter: A mysterious form of matter that does not emit light but exerts gravitational effects (about 27%).
Dark Energy: A form of energy thought to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe(68%)..

        Theories and Observations:
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Big Bang Theory: The most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the universe. It posits that the universe began as an incredibly hot and dense point and has been expanding ever since.
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The faint glow left over from the Big Bang, which provides evidence of the early universe and its rapid expansion.
Multiverse Hypothesis: Some theories suggest that our universe could be one of many, existing within a broader "multiverse."
The universe is still full of mysteries, and scientists continue to explore its nature, structure, and ultimate fate.
